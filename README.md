# OOP-Programming

OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model or paradigm which revolves around the concept of “OBJECTS”. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that contain some characteristics and behaviors specified in the class template.

## What is the need of OOPS?
There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are: 

->OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they don’t know the actual implementation.
->With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.
->Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.

## Advantages of OOPs
->OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
->Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.
->OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
->OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.
->OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach.\
->Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs
