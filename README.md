# OOP-Programming

OOPs, or Object-Oriented Programming is a programming model or paradigm which revolves around the concept of “OBJECTS”. Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that contain some characteristics and behaviors specified in the class template.

## What is the need of OOPS?
There are many reasons why OOPs is mostly preferred, but the most important among them are: 

->OOPs helps users to understand the software easily, although they don’t know the actual implementation.\
->With OOPs, the readability, understandability, and maintainability of the code increase multifold.\
->Even very big software can be easily written and managed easily using OOPs.

## Advantages of OOPs
->OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.\
->Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.\
->OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.\
->OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.\
->OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach.\
->Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs

## What is Class?
A class can be understood as a template or a blueprint, which contains some values, known as member data or member, and some set of rules, known as behaviors or functions. So when an object is created, it automatically takes the data and functions that are defined in the class.\
Therefore the class is basically a template or blueprint for objects. Also one can create as many objects as they want based on a class.\
For example, first, a car’s template is created. Then multiple units of car are created based on that template.

## What is Object?
Objects can be considered as real-world instances of entities like class, that contain some characteristics and behaviors specified in the class template.\
Objects are considered the instance of a class, and are therefore sometimes called “instances”. The term “characteristics” refers to the “what” about the Object, and the term “behavior” refers to the “how” about the Object.

## Constructor
Constructor is the function which is called when object is created.Constructors are special methods whose name is the same as the class name. The constructors serve the special purpose of initializing the objects.

### Types of Constructor
-- Default Constructor\
-- Paramaterized Constructor\
-- Copy Cconstructor\
